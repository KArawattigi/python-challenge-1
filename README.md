### *Order System*
1. Create an empty list. This list will later store a customer's order in dictionary format, as follows:
```
[
  {
    "Item name": "string",
    "Price": float,
    "Quantity": int
  },
  {
    "Item name": "string",
    "Price": float,
    "Quantity": int
  },
]
```

2. After the sub-menu is printed, prompt the customer to enter their selection from the menu, saving it as a variable ```menu_selection```.

3. Use input validation to check if the customer input ```menu_selection``` is a number. If it isn't, print an error message. If it is a number, convert the input to an integer and use it to check if it is in the keys of ```menu_items```.

4. If the user input is not in the ```menu_items``` keys, print an error. Otherwise, perform the following actions:

    - Get the item name from the ```menu_items``` dictionary and store it as a variable.

    - Ask the customer for the quantity of the menu item, using the item name variable in the question, and let them know that the quantity will default to ```1``` if their input is invalid. Save their answer as a variable called ```quantity```.

    - Check that the customer input is a number. If it isn't, set the ```quantity``` to the value ```1```. If it is a number, convert the variable to an integer.

    - Append the customer's order to the order list in dictionary format with the following keys: ```"Item name"```, ```"Price"```, and ```"Quantity"```. You will need this information to print the receipt at the end of the order. The price should be found in the menu_items dictionary.

5. Inside the continuous ```while``` loop that prompts the customer if they would like to keep ordering, write a ```match:case``` statement that checks for ```y``` or ```n``` (upper or lowercase), and includes a default option if neither letter is entered by the customer. The following actions should be performed for each case:

    - ```y```: Set the ```place_order``` variable to ```True``` and break from the continuous while loop.

    - ```n```: Set the ```place_order``` variable to ```False```, print "Thank you for your order", and break from the continuous while loop.

    - Default: Tell the customer to try again because they didn't type a valid input.

### *Order Receipt*
6. Create a ```for``` loop to loop through the order list.

7. Inside the loop, save the value of each key as their own variable: ```item_name```, ```price```, and ```quantity```.

8. Calculate the number of empty spaces that should be added to the display so that the receipt uses the following format:
```
Item name                 | Price  | Quantity
--------------------------|--------|----------
Apple                     | $0.49  | 1
Tea - Thai iced           | $3.99  | 2
Fried banana              | $4.49  | 3
```
9. Create the space strings as their own variables using string multiplication.

10. Print the line for the receipt using the format in Step 8.

11. Upon exiting the ```for``` loop, use **list comprehension** and ```sum()``` to calculate the total price of the order and display it to the customer. ***Make sure you multiply the price by the quantity in your list comprehension.***

### Extras 
- if the item name contains a ```-``` then insert the word "count" before then item name 
- if the item quantity is greater than 1 then append ``` `s``` 
- if the item name does not contain ```-``` and quantity is greater than 1 then append ``` `s``` after the item name 

- if the same item is added to the order more than 1 time update the order quantity
